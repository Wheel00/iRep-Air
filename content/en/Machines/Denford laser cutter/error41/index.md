## Root Cause

This error usually happens after the rotary engraving fixture's been plugged in and out. The z axis needs to be recalibrated after using the rotary fixture.

## Fix

Make sure the "auto z" in the second tab of the ULS software is turned on, **please contact hardware team to fix it.**
