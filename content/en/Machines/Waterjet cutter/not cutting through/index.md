## Root Cause

There could be a blockage of wet sand in the tube, check it the tube is necked. The distance between the nozzle and the top surface of the material might be too close as well.

## Fix

Pull out the tube and change a new one in, leave the tube to dry and see if able to clean the sand out of it.

If the nozzle tip and the top of the material is too close, move the nozzle up a bit.
