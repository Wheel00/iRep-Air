## Root Cause

The toolholder is expanded due to heat during the operation, normal pulling won't get it out.

## Fix

Get help from another rep/friend.

One needs to press the white button inside the machine (tool loading button), keep it pressed down. The other needs to use a mallet to **gently** tap on the toolholder to get it out. Shown below.
