## Root Cause

The compressed air inlet valve might be turned off or the regulator value shown below might be turned on (example shown below is turned off).

**The pressure shown on the regulator should be between 6-8 bars, otherwise it could be the insufficient pressure that cause the loading button not working.**

## Fix

Turn on the compressed air inlet valve (yellow handle at the back of the machine), if air is leaking, then turn **off** the regulator value shown in the position above.

If the pressure is out of range (6-8 bars), there's nothing could be done (happened very few times before), usually wait for a while and the pressure will recover.
