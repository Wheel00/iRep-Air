## Root Cause

If both emergency stop has been pulled out, power is plugged however the machine just won't start when the green button is pressed, this indicates the circuit breaker has been tripped.

## Fix

Hardware team is not authorized to reset the circuit breaker in the power supply box, please contact Ryan/Ellis.
