## Possible Root Causes:

### Case A

The user are feeding the material too fast.

### Fix

Tell them to feed the material slower.

---

### Case B

Rollers are in contact with the running blade.

### Fix

There are three rollers to keep the blade in place which are shown below.


You can turn the handle shown below to loosen/tighten the guard, adjust the gap between the single roller on the top and the blade to about 3-5mm (Don't leave too much gap otherwise the blade is more likely to slip off), Check if the blade is centered between the two rollers.


---

### Case C

Blades are blunt.

### Fix

Please contact hardware team.
