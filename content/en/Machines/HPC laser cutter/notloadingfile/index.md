## Root Cause

1. The DXF file needs to be 'import'ed into the software, not 'open'.

2. Some files have non-english filename, you won't be able to see the file when selecting from 'import'.

## Fix

Remember to click 'import'.

Change the filename to english characters if necessary.

Use AutoCad to clean the file and export as new.
